    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mt-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Altitude Complications:</strong> At 5,280 feet, gas appliances and HVAC systems require specific calibration for proper combustion and efficiency. 
        Improper setup can lead to dangerous carbon monoxide buildup or wasted energy.
      </li>

        <strong>The Freeze-Thaw Cycle:</strong> Colorado winters are notorious for rapid temperature drops. This puts immense stress on pipes, roofing materials, and concrete.
