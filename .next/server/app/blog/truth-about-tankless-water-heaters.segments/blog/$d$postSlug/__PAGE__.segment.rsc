    <div class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg space-y-6">

      Our technicians are locals who understand:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mt-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Altitude Complications:</strong> At 5,280 feet, gas appliances and HVAC systems require specific calibration for proper combustion and efficiency. 
        Improper setup can lead to dangerous carbon monoxide buildup or wasted energy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Freeze-Thaw Cycle:</strong> Colorado winters are notorious for rapid temperature drops. This puts immense stress on pipes, roofing materials, and concrete.
        We specialize in <strong>leak detection denver</strong> techniques that protect your home from bursting pipes and ice dams.
